I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my English teacher for giving me the opportunity to work on this project titled “Sports Scenario of India: Do Players or Owners Make a Team?”. This topic helped me understand the structure of Indian sports, the importance of teamwork, and the roles played by both players and owners in building successful teams. I would also like to thank my classmates, friends, and family for their guidance and support in completing this assignment.
